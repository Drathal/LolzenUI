## LolzenUI
This is my personal User Interface for World of Warcraft.

It is a compilation of different utilities for either information, feature, ease-of-life addition or anything of that sort.

------
### embedded Libs:
**LibItemUpgradeInfo-1.0**

As blizzards API doesn't perfectly well work (heirlooms, upgrades, ..) LolzenUI makes use of this lib.

**LibSharedMedia-3.0**

Can be used to easily add custom fonts and textures to LolzenUI.

**oUF**

the Unitframes and Nameplates integrated make use of oUF.

------
### Some AddOn Suggestions to complement LolzenUI:
- BaudBag (or any other Bag addon)
- BonusRollPreview
- ChatLootIcons
- ConvertRatings
- Doom_CooldownPulse
- EasyDeleteConfirm
- GnomishAuctionShrinker
- GnomishVendorShrinker
- HideTalkingHead
- Molinari
- NameplateRange
- QuickQuest
- tekability
- tekErr
- tekKompare
- teksLoot
- Tipachu
- tullaRange
- VendorBait
- xanErrorDevourer
